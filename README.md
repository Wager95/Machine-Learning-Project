# My first machine learning project.
 
 **This is my first machine learning project for my Machine Learning class at Hult International Business School.**
 
 **This repository consists of 4 files in the respective order:**
 1. Dictionary for the different variables in the dataset.
 2. The analysed dataset.
 3. Read Me
 4. The Python code
 5. The insight report. 
 
 **I will be redoing this analysis at some point, given the code is messy and sometimes unclear.**
